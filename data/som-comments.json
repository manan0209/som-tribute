I‚Äôll make it so normal mode has a block cursor and insert mode the usual ‚Äúline‚Äù cursor. Maybe I‚Äôll add the dreaded replace mode too, with the little slab cursor (it just overwrites characters rather than ‚Äúsmartly‚Äù insert them)About the command mode: this is perhaps a bit weird if you don‚Äôt use vim‚Ä¶ command mode lets you type commands like ‚Äúq‚Äù (to quit the editor,) ‚Äúw‚Äù (to write/save the file,) ‚Äúe [filename]‚Äù (to open text files,) etc. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm implementing here.

If you want to fact-check that, you can. You can copy the background image and search it up with Google, and you‚Äôll find that.

There was a quote, ‚ÄúWe shape our tools and our tools shape us.‚Äù In this way, I think we‚Äôre letting these tools shape us too much, if we‚Äôre giving up creativity and passion for efficiency. It‚Äôs a bit dystopian.",

We don‚Äôt have to put up a front, and pretend we‚Äôre good at anything‚Ä¶   Well, non-philosophically,  I‚Äôm very genuinely hoping that you DID AI-generate some of these docs (it reads a little bit that way). From my experience with chatting with an AI, managing React & database stuff is an absolute nightmare. The systems get pretty complicated fast, especially the more niche something is. Granted, I was talking to GPT, idk how your experience with Cursor is.    If you‚Äôve ever looked at someone else‚Äôs code before, you‚Äôll probably understand the feeling of just fundamentally not understanding their structure. Uh, I guess that‚Äôs how I feel about AI code a lot of the time. I do feel kinda strongly about this topic. Anyway, I‚Äôd be open to any of your thoughts on it! (hopefully not AI generated thoughts, as those tend to be quite repetitive)",
